# Pregnancy-Loss-Genetics
R codes to study genetics of pregnancy loss in horses. Multiple samples from 256 product of conceptus (POCs) underwent chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and short tandem repeat profiling using multiple STR markers. Ploidy status were also confirmed using 30X whole genome sequencing and 10X whole genome Nextera sequecing on selected samples.
