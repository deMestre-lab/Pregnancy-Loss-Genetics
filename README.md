# Pregnancy-Loss-Genetics
R codes to study genetics of pregnancy loss in horses. Multiple samples from 256 product of conceptus (POCs) underwent chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and short tandem repeat profiling using multiple STR markers. Ploidy status were also confirmed using 30X whole genome sequencing and 10X whole genome Nextera sequecing on selected samples.

R codes prvided were used to merge copy number variation segments, generating plots for summary statistics of the data, generating BAF and LRR plots, and a chromosome synteny plot between human and horse genome
